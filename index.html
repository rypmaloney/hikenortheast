            <h3>Purpose of this site</h3>
            <p>Welcome to hike the North East. My name is Ryan Maloney and I am an amateur hiker and outdoor enthusiast. When I say amateur, I mean AMATEUR. My interest in hiking was sparked three years ago on a three month long cross country road trip. I hit many of the National Parks and spent nearly the entire time hiking and camping.</p>

            <p>If you’ve found yourself on this site, you’re probably familiar with other hiking-centric websites like Alltrails. This site is meant to be a little different. Hiking websites are generally overflowing with information, with a goal of covering all trails, all everywhere. That leaves little room for personality or intimacy.
                </p>

            <p>The purpose of HiketheNorthEast is more personal. I’ll outline hikes that only I have taken personally and share tips tricks and thoughts about them. This is the exact opposite of comprehensive, but there will be no sterile listing of stats (though there will be some stats).</p>
            <p><em><b>In the spirit of collaboration: I want you to contribute! A single man can only explore so many places. If you took hike that inspired you, <a href="contact.html">visit the contact page,</a> write a review, and I’ll incorporate it in the website.</b> </em> </p>

            <h3>Easy, Moderate, or Difficult?</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Not olympic athlete? Thats okay, neither am I. I’m not in shape, not out of shape. This will be the barometer for hike difficulty categorization. </p>
            <p>The hikes outlined will be broken down into three categories: easy, moderate, and difficult. These categories, much like everything else on this site, are entirely subjective. Generally, the difficulty categorization will reflect distance (how far is the hike?), duration (how long did it take me to finish it?), terrain (did I do any scrambling?) and elevation gain (how high did it take you?). It takes different people different durations to finish hikes, so I can only speak for myself. However, most of my rankings will probably fall pretty close to that of other sites. </p>

                <li>Bring water. Like way more water than you think you need. </li>
                <li>Give yourself a generous amount of time for the more strenuous hikes. And even if you don’t plan on being out after dark, have a flashlight just in case. I’ve been caught returning from a peak after dark without a light, and it really is no fun. Not to mention it’s one of the more dangerous hiking-oriented situations to put yourself in. </li>
                <li>Wear layers. Be flexible with your attire. </li>
                <li>Tell someone where you’re going. This is especially true for the more strenuous or secluded hikes. </li>
                <li>Bring snacks.</li>
