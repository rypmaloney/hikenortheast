            <h3>About this website </h3>
            <p>
                HikeNortheast is kind of niche website, I know. The goal is to serve up personal preferences instead of—perhaps more usefully—technical information. Upon beginning this project, I made one important realization. As an individual, it was unlikely I would be able to compete with the depth and quality of data provided by larger hiking/trekking/camping websites. The best I could do was offer an inferior product. So, instead, I thought I would provide something more personal. This website only reviews hikes that I personally have taken, so the information I provide is subjective. </p>
            <p>
                Because hike data alone seems to sterile, I thought I would infuse it with something softer, brighter, and in some ways more meaningful: literature. If this website highlights the outdoor experiences that have influenced me, it ought point to the writing about those types of experiences that does the same. With that in mind, I want to capture the broadest possible audience, so please, contribute! Visit the contact page and send information about a hike or relevant literature that inspires you!</p>

            <p class="quote">“This is what you shall do; Love the earth and sun and the animals, despise riches, give alms to every one that asks, stand up for the stupid and crazy, devote your income and labor to others, hate tyrants, argue not concerning God, have patience and indulgence toward the people, take off your hat to nothing known or unknown or to any man or number of men, go freely with powerful uneducated persons and with the young and with the mothers of families, read these leaves in the open air every season of every year of your life, re-examine all you have been told at school or church or in any book, dismiss whatever insults your own soul, and your very flesh shall be a great poem and have the richest fluency not only in its words but in the silent lines of its lips and face and between the lashes of your eyes and in every motion and joint of your body.”

            <p class="quote">"Springtime in Massachusetts is depressing for those who embrace a progressive view of history and experience. It does not gradually develop as spring is supposed to. Instead, the crocuses bloom and the grass grows, but the foliage is independent from the weather, which gets colder and colder and sadder and sadder until June when one day it becomes brutishly hot without warning...It was fitting, then, that the first people who chose to settle there were mentally suspect.”

We can never have enough of nature.”
